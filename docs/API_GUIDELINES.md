# API Guidelines (moved)

High-level API expectations, endpoint flows, validation and response shapes.

- Keep validation in Zod schemas.
- Controllers orchestrate services; business logic lives in Services; DB access in Repositories.
- Use consistent response envelopes and status codes as documented in ARCHITECTURE.md.

(Full API guidelines remain in this file — previously at the repository root.)
