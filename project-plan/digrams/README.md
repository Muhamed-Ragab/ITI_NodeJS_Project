# API Flowcharts

This folder contains Mermaid flowcharts for the API modules, plus Excalidraw imports.

## Quick start (Mermaid Live Editor)
1. Open the Mermaid Live Editor.
2. Copy the contents of any `.mmd` file in this folder.
3. Paste into the editor to render the diagram.

## Draw.io (diagrams.net)
Draw.io uses a stricter Mermaid parser, so the `.mmd` files are already updated with quoted labels.

Steps:
1. Open diagrams.net and create a blank diagram.
2. Go to **Arrange → Insert → Advanced → Mermaid**.
3. Paste the Mermaid text from any `.mmd` file.
4. Click **Insert** and export as PNG/SVG if needed.

## Excalidraw
We include Excalidraw files that embed the Mermaid source:
- `excalidraw/*.excalidraw`

Steps:
1. Open an `.excalidraw` file.
2. Copy the Mermaid text block from the canvas.
3. Use **Insert → Mermaid** and paste to render.
